    "# Answering Business Questions using SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store. In this project, a modified version of a database called Chinook will be analysed to answer some business questions, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which album should the company promote first?\n",
    "- How is the performance of the sales support agent?\n",
    "- How is the sales in different country? Is there any potential market?\n",
    "- What is the ratio of album purchase and non-album purchase?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of results\n",
    "- For the four genres we want to investigate, Hip-Hop, Punk, Pop, Blues, Punk tracks sell the best in the USA, following by Blues, Pop, and finally Hip Hop tracks. It seems like a good option to select the Punk album to promote first.\n",
    "- The sales performance of three Sales Support Agents are even.\n",
    "- USA is the biggest market, with 13 customer and 1040 USD sales in total.\n",
    "- Czech Republic has the highest average sales per customer and average order value.\n",
    "- Czech Republic and India could be the potential markets, since they have average sales per customer and average order value. But the amount of data is relatively low, the result may not be conclusive.\n",
    "- Non-album purchase contributed 80% of the purchases.\n"
